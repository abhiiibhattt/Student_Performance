# ðŸŽ“ Predicting Student Success with Deep Learning

This repository contains the complete implementation for the term paper, *"Predicting Student Success in South Indian Universities: A Deep Learning Approach to Analyzing Virtual Learning Engagement."* The project explores and compares various machine learning models to predict student performance based on their engagement in a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE).

## ðŸ§ª About The Project

The primary goal of this research is to evaluate how effectively deep learning models can identify at-risk students early in a semester. We compare the performance of traditional machine learning algorithms against sequence-aware deep learning models on a rich set of student engagement metrics.

This codebase allows for the complete replication of the paper's experiments, from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization.

### **Important Note on Data**
The dataset used in this project, `DL(Term_Paper).csv`, is **entirely synthetic and randomly generated**. It was created for the sole purpose of this academic experiment. **It does not contain any real student information or data from any university.**

## ðŸ¤– Models Implemented

The project provides a comparative analysis of four different models:

* **Random Forest Regressor** (Baseline)
* **XGBoost Regressor** (Baseline)
* **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network** (Deep Learning)
* **Transformer Network** (Deep Learning)
